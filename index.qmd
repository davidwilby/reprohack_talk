## Why is reproducibility important for research?

<br>

::: incremental
- ## Verification :heavy_check_mark:
- ## Re-use :recycle:
- ## Longevity :hourglass_flowing_sand:
- ## Efficiency :watch:

## Is there a problem with reproducibility?

## Different kinds of reproducibility

<br>

::: incremental
- ## Experimental :scientist:
    - **Resource-intensive**
    - **Costly**
    - **Harder to describe**
- ## Analytical :technologist:
    - **Well-represented by code**
    - **Probably easier to reproduce**
   
:::

## What *isn't* reproducibility?

#### Definitely not :x:

> "...results were produced using custom MATLAB scripts..."

> "Code/data available on reasonable request.."

#### Up for debate :question:

-   Equations only?
-   Proprietary software?
-   Spreadsheets?

. . .

> only those who are faultless have the right to pass judgment on others

## How can we do it? (1/2)

<br>

::: incremental

-   Research data management :floppy_disk:
-   Version control :octopus:
-   Open source development :woman_technologist:
-   Documentation :scroll:
-   Tutorials :woman_teacher:
-   Literate programming (e.g. [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [quarto](https://quarto.org/), [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/))
-   Envrionment management (e.g. [Conda](https://conda.io/) :snake:, [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) :rat:, [docker](https://docker.com/) :whale:)
-   Talk to each other! :busts_in_silhouette:

## Barriers to reproducibility :construction:

. . .

<br>

*sensu* [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-barriers.html)

* Requires additional skills
* May make you (feel) vulnerable
* Publication bias toward novel findings
* Limited benefit to career advancement
* Support other users of your code
* Can make your mistakes public

## Advantages :tada:

<br>

* Validation
* Reusability
* Longevity
* Efficiency

. . .

* Facilitate collaboration and review process
* Publish validated research and avoid misinformation
* Write your papers, thesis and reports efficiently
* Get credits for your work fairly
* Ensure continuity of your work

## **Now it's time to..**

![](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/raw/master/assets/reprohack-banner.png)

. . .

1. ### :page_with_curl: Find an interesting paper
2. ### :dart: Try to follow the authors' instructions to reproduce it!
3. ### :tipping_hand_person: Give friendly feedback
4. ### :superhero_woman: Learn!


## Choosing a paper

1. **Get up and look around the room** :eyes:
2. **Choose from Reprohack database: [reprohack.org/paper](https://www.reprohack.org/paper/)** :books:

. . .

### Consider:

::: {.incremental}
* **programming language & tools**
* **topic**
* **computational intensity**
* **previous reproducibility score**
* **use the tags or search to narrow down**
* **could I learn something new?**
:::

## Reproducing the paper

<br>

- ### where is the code?
- ### where is the data?
- ### what hardware do you need to run the code?
- ### what software do you need to run the code?
- ### are there instructions to follow?

## Reviewing

<font size="6">**Think about:**</font>

- **how easy was it to get the data?** :floppy_disk:
- **how easy was it to get the code?** :computer:
- **what was or wasn't documented well?** :open_book:
- **reproducibility score (?/10)** :slot_machine:

. . .

### Be kind!

ðŸ‘€ [**ReproHack Code of Conduct**](https://reprohack.org/code-of-conduct)

. . .

### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!

- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

## Thank you Authors! :raised_hands:

<br>

- ### Without them there would be no ReproHack

<br>

- ### Show gratitude and appreciation for their effort and courage :pray:

<br>

- ### Constructive criticism only please!

## How to ReproHack

1.  **Choose a paper**
    -   **from [reprohack.org/paper/](http://reprohack.org/paper/)**
    -   **or from those in the room**
2.  **Find some team mates (if you like!)**
3.  **Have a go at reproducing the results**
4.  **Feed back to the author(s) - nicely!**
    - **Find your paper on [reprohack.org](http://reprohack.org)**
    - **Fill in the feedback form**
5.  *Optionally* **repeat**! :grinning:
